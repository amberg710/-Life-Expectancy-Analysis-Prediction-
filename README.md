# -Life-Expectancy-Analysis-Prediction- [Life Expectancy PySpark Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1kVMDfcF1yaSFohk2hAlezOryqlX7kWX-)

This Colab notebook analyzes global life expectancy data, taking raw country-level health and demographic data and applying data cleaning, missing value imputation, feature engineering, regression and classification modeling using PySpark, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.

It includes steps for data exploration, preprocessing, correlation analysis, model training and evaluation, and visualization of trends and key insights. This end-to-end workflow demonstrates how to generate actionable insights, predict life expectancy, and compare countries based on health and socioeconomic indicators.
